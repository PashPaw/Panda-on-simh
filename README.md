# Panda Distribution on simh

Currently, there isn't much here.  It contains:

- A basic installation script (install.ini) for Richard Cornwell's KL-10B simulator.

- A boot.ini for debugging and running standalone. 

- An ether.ini for a dedicated networking interface.

Instructions, and a prepared image, can be found here:
